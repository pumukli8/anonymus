These are experimental files for Digispark, ESP32 devices. In addition, 
there are also some files encrypted with the Shellter program belonging 
to the Kali Linux system. I created these solely for study purposes and f
or my own amusement. But of course, if you want, feel free to use these 
files or get ideas from them! I try to expand the number of devices day 
by day with more or less success. I hope I could help.
